 @method connection:needNewBodyStream:  
 @abstract This method is called whenever an NSURLConnection
 determines that it the client needs to provide a new, unopened
 body stream.  This can occur if the request had a body stream
 set on it and requires retransmission.
 @discussion This method gives the delegate an opportunity to
 attach a new, unopened body stream to the connection to handle
 situations where the stream data needs to be retransmitted.  In the
 past on Mac OS X the stream data was spooled to disk in case retransmission
 was required, which may not be desirable for large data sets.  By
 implementing this delegate method the client is opting in to no longer
 having the data spooled to disk - for each retransmission a new stream
 needs to be provided.  Returning NULL from this delegate method will cause
 the connection to fail.
 @param connection an NSURLConnection that has determined that it
 required a new body stream to continue.
 @param request The current NSURLRequest object associated with the connection.
 @result The new unopened body stream to use (see setHTTPBodyStream).

 @method connection:canAuthenticateAgainstProtectionSpace:
 @abstract This method gives the delegate an opportunity to inspect an NSURLProtectionSpace before an authentication attempt is made.
 @discussion If implemented, will be called before connection:didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge 
 to give the delegate a chance to inspect the protection space that will be authenticated against.  Delegates should determine
 if they are prepared to respond to the authentication method of the protection space and if so, return YES, or NO to
 allow default processing to handle the authentication.  If this delegate is not implemented, then default 
 processing will occur (typically, consulting
 the user's keychain and/or failing the connection attempt.
 @param connection an NSURLConnection that has an NSURLProtectionSpace ready for inspection
 @param protectionSpace an NSURLProtectionSpace that will be used to generate an authentication challenge
 @result a boolean value that indicates the willingness of the delegate to handle the authentication

 should not consult the credential storage for the connection.
 @discussion This method will be called before any attempt to authenticate is
 attempted on a connection.  By returning NO the delegate is telling the
 connection to not consult the credential storage and taking responsiblity
 for providing any credentials for authentication challenges.  Not implementing
 this method is the same as returing YES.  The delegate is free to consult the
 credential storage itself when it receives a didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge
 message.

 @discussion Load data is delivered incrementally. Clients can
 concatenate each successive NSData object delivered through this
 method over the course of an asynchronous load to build up the
 complete data for a URL load. It is also important to note that this
 method provides the only way for an ansynchronous delegate to find
 out about load data. In other words, it is the responsibility of the
 delegate to retain or copy this data as it is delivered through this
 method.

 associated with the url request.
 @discussion This method is called as the body (message data) of a request 
 is transmitted (as during an http POST).  It provides the number of bytes 
 written for the latest write, the total number of bytes written and the 
 total number of bytes the connection expects to write (for HTTP this is 
 based on the content length). The total number of expected bytes may change
 if the request needs to be retransmitted (underlying connection lost, authentication
 challenge from the server, etc.).
